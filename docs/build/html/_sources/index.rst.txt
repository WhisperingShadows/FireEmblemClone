Welcome to the documentation for my fully-Python Fire Emblem Heroes (FEH) clone!
================================================================================

Hiya Lucca! Hey Vi! And greetings to all others!

This project, in all its various forms scattered across the internet, is (rather unimaginatively)
named FireEmblemClone. Its intended goal is to be a perfect (or nearly perfect) copy of the popular
Nintendo mobile game Fire Emblem Heroes written in pure Python. There's no reason for this project
other than that I have a mean losing streak in the gambling-esque adventure that is summoning in FEH,
and I'm fed up with it. This project is licensed under `GNU General Public License v3.0
<https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/>`_, so feel free to
edit, make suggestions, or expand in any way you'd like (so long as you keep it open source).
My code and other files can be found at
`this Github repository <https://github.com/WhisperingShadows/FireEmblemClone>`_.
